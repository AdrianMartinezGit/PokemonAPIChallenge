I used my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS to create my own functioning and responsive Pokédex styled with the Tailwind CSS Framework, with the following features:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Display 1st - 5th Gen Pokémon [x]</li>
    <li>Search for Pokémon by name and Pokedex Number [x]</li>
    <li>Ability to get a Random Pokémon [x]</li>
    <li>Display both images of Pokémon and Shiny Form [x]</li>
    <li>Display Pokémon Name [x]</li>
    <li>Show 1 location from any game [x]</li>
    <li>Display Element Types [x]</li>
    <li>List all possible abilities and moves [x]</li>
    <li>Show Evolutionary Paths [x]</li>
    <li>Display Favorites List[x]</li>
</ul>

This is a very cool application that functions smoothly and is responsive for all screen sizes! I did notice a couple of issues during testing. The "Bug" type badge did not show an image or alt tag for those types of Pokemon. Also, the favorites functionality has some quirks. If I open the favorites drawer and I delete Pokemon other than the current Pokemon displayed, the current Pokemon "+" icon will change into a "-" icon despite that not being the Pokemon that was deleted. When returning to the favorites drawer again, the favorite Pokemon that were deleted previously are occasionally stil showing. The +/- icon indicator is sometimes not always accurate to what is listed in the favorites as a result.
